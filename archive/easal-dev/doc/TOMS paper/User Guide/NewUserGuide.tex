\maketitle
This is a user/developer guide for the EASAL software described in
the accompanying TOMS paper for generating, describing topology and exploring the
assembly configuration space of two rigid sets of points in $R^3$ that are
mutually constrained by distance intervals. Technical concepts and definitions that are 
required to use this software can be found in the main paper.


\section{Introduction}
EASAL generates and describes the key aspects of the topology and geometry of
assembly configuration space of two rigid sets of points in $R^3$
~\cite{Sitharam:2012:EASAL, Ozkan2014MainEasal, Wu2014Virus}. EASAL implements
algorithms that use new theoretical results, some of which are presented in
~\cite{Ozkan2014MainEasal, SiGa:2010, Sitharam:2012:EASAL}.
EASAL is opensource and can be downloaded from
\url{https://www.bitbucket.org/geoplexity/EASAL}. This user guide describes in
depth the key conceptual functionalities, dependencies and installation, and
the major classes and methods in EASAL.  The user can find a detailed example
of how to use the software in the README.md file which can be found along with
the source code. A video presenting the theory, applications, and software
components of EASAL is available at
\url{http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~rprabhu/EASALvideo.mpg}.

\noindent\textbf{Organization:} The remainder of this guide is organized as
follows. Section \ref{functionalities} discusses the main functionalities
offered by EASAL. Section \ref{dependency} gives a description of the software
dependencies and installation instructions. Section \ref{sec:run} describes an
example run to help the user understand how the software is used.
Section \ref{sec:architecture} gives details of the major classes,
attributes and methods to help developers gain an insight into how EASAL  has
been implemented.

\section{Software Functionalities}
\label{functionalities}
This section introduces the main functionalities of EASAL.


\subsection{Input/Output}

\subsubsection{Input}
Input to EASAL is specified using the input window (see \figref{inputwindow}).
The main input features are the following:
\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Two rigid point sets}: \emph{the data for molecule
		(A/B)} field is used to specify the rigid point sets. This accepts the
		data in the pdb format.  The user can either type in the location of
		the input point sets files or select it using the browse option. Once a
		file has been selected, the \emph{set data} option allows the user to edit
		the input data before starting sampling.
\item \textbf{The pairwise distance constraints (potential energy or enthalpy
		function)}: There are three types of constraints.

\item \textbf{Bonding threshold}: This is the range of distances between atoms
		where bond formation is feasible (i.e., the attractive forces dominate). 
		this is given as $\lambda*(r_i+r_j) 
		\pm \delta$ namely the Lennard-Jones well. 
		Here, $\lambda$ is specified by the lambda text field in
		the input window and $\delta$ is specified by the delta text box in the
		input window. $r_i$ and $r_j$ are the radii of the atoms participating
		in the reaction. When predefined interactions are specified, we use those
		for the bond formation and use the bonding threshold only for the hard-sphere
		potentials for the points not involved in the bond formation.

\item \textbf{Collision threshold:} This is the minimum distance between points or atoms. This too is given as $\lambda*(r_i+r_j)
		\pm \delta$.
		
\item \textbf{Predefined Interactions}: Only when the constraints between these pairs are active, are the corresponding configuration space regions explored. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output}
The output is the \emph{atlas} (see \figref{atlas}), i.e., a topologically stratified
set of sample feasible realizations or configurations of the two rigid point
sets. In EASAL the output is visualized by what we call the \emph{sweep view}. One
point set is  held fixed, while the other set is drawn many times to trace out
the set of all feasible realizations.

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{fig/Stratification.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Stratification of an assembly constraint system with atlas nodes of
    dimension 4 (cyan), 3 (blue), 2 (purple), 1 (yellow), and 0 (green). Strata of
	each dimension of the assembly constraint system visualized in the
	lower right inset are shown as nodes of one color and shape in a
	directed acyclic graph. Each node represents an active constraint
region. Edges indicate containment in a parent region one dimension higher.}
\label{atlas}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Stratification}
When EASAL first starts, the user is presented with the \emph{atlas view} (see
\figref{atlasview}). The atlas view shows the stratification of the
configuration space into regions of various dimensions, known as the active
constraint regions. The stratification is a directed acyclic graph where each
node represents an active constraint region and is associated with an active
constraint graph and edges represent immediate containment of a region within
its parent region.  Here, the user can use the following functionalities. 

\subsubsection{Active Constraint Graph} 
When a node is clicked, EASAL automatically loads the active constraint graph
(see \figref{atlasview}) associated with that node in the bottom left corner.
This active constraint graph shows only the participating points from each set.
A solid edge between two points indicates a constraint and a dashed edge
indicates a parameter between two points belonging to different sets. It has to
be noted that the points in the same set already form a clique (not shown in
the graph).

\subsubsection{Finding Bounding Regions} 
Clicking \emph{tree} (see \figref{atlasview}) after selecting a particular node from
the atlas shows us all the bounding regions of that node. In terms of the atlas, it shows  
the ancestors and descendants of that node . Since an edge in the graph represents 
containment, this feature allows us to inspect the containment of regions.
Note that the bounding regions are also shown in the Cayley space view.

\subsubsection{Finding Paths Between Nodes with 6 Active constraints}
The atlas output by EASAL can be used to generate all the paths between any two active
constraint regions along with their energies. Once the atlas has been generated, 
finding paths is \emph{nearly instantaneous}. The path topology of 
the assembly configuration space is crucial for understanding assembly kinetics.

Of particular interest is finding paths between two lowest energy
configurations with 6 active constraints or 0D nodes of the atlas with effectively rigid 
configurations. We are mainly interested in paths through active constraint regions with 5 
or 6 active constraints (which are one step higher energy and have one fewer constraint). 
Such paths represent a continuous one degree of freedom motion.

Whenever the user clicks on two nodes in succession, EASAL finds the path between the two 
nodes, if it exists, and writes this path as a series of nodes to the 
``paths.txt'' file. Once the sampling has been completed, EASAL computes the total number of paths of a particular length between every pair of vertices and writes the entire matrix to the ``path\_matrix.txt'' file. The user can specify lengths by setting the ``path\_length'' parameter in the settings.ini file.

\subsubsection{Sampling Options} 
The user can at any point stop the current sampling mode and redirect the
sampling. The various options available are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Stop Sampling}: Clicking this button stops the sampling of the
		atlas and presents options to redirect the sampling.
\item \textbf{The Constraint Selection Dialogue Box}: This dialogue box (see Figure~\ref
		{CSD}) allows the user to select a particular node from the atlas and start
		sampling from that node. This feature gives users the flexibility to
		explore regions of the graph that are more relevant to them. The user
		can select a node by either specifying a node number or by specifying
		active constraints between the point sets. The spheres with the indices
		denote the atoms. A thick line between the atoms indicates a
		participating bond.  Here, the first constraint is mandatory and hence
		does not have a \emph{connect} check box next to it. The rest of the Active
		constraints are optional and the user may choose up to six.
		\begin{figure}[h] 
				\centering 
				\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{fig/DumbbellSelection.png} 
				\caption{Constraint Selection Dialogue} 
				\label{CSD} 
		\end{figure}

\item \textbf{CUR}: On clicking this, the sampling starts from the node that is
		currently selected and ends when the tree in which the node is present
		is fully sampled.
\item \textbf{Cleanup}: Clicking this completes sampling on all partially
		sampled trees.
\item \textbf{A-S}: A-S stands for Auto-Solve. This button starts sampling in
		the auto-solve mode. This is the default sampling mode. When starting
		afresh in this mode, EASAL generates all possible 4D and 5D root nodes
		depending on the user input. Then it proceeds to recursively sample all
		these nodes till the atlas generation is complete. If there is a
		partially generated atlas, this mode of sampling completes	 the
		unfinished trees and then proceeds to sample all the other root nodes.
\item \textbf{BFS}: Clicking this button forces EASAL to explore the atlas in
		a breadth first fashion which it otherwise does in a depth first
		fashion. In this mode of sampling, EASAL starts from the
		node currently selected and samples its subtree to completion.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dimension of the root node}
By default, the dimension of the root node of the atlas is 5, which means that
the root node has one bond and 5 parameters. The \emph{4D root node} option in the
\emph{advanced options} (see \figref{advancedoptions}) allows the user to change
this and make the root node a 4D node. With a 4D root node, there are 2 bonds
and 4 parameters in the root node.

\subsection{Convex Cayley Parametrization}
After selecting a node, the user can view its Cayley configuration space shown
in the \emph{Cayley space view} (see \figref{Cayleyspaceview}). The Cayley space
view shows the active constraint region in the Cayley parametrized chart
representation for a particular node.

\subsubsection{Inspect Cayley Points}
The user can view the Cayley points in the Cayley Space View (see
\figref{Cayleyspaceview}). The Cayley points are shown on a 3D grid. For nodes
of dimension higher than 3d, one slider per extra dimension is given to view
the points in the $4^{th}$ and $5^{th}$ dimensions.

\noindent\textbf{Categorization of Cayley points:} In the Cayley Space View
(see \figref{Cayleyspaceview}), initially green points are shown which
correspond to all the realizable points in the Cayley space. Clicking on the
red square at the bottom shows the points that have collision.  Clicking
the red square also shows two more options viz., cyan and pink. The cyan points
represent the points which have angle violations and the pink points represent
points which have distance violations. Clicking on the blue square shows all the
points sampled. The blue points represent geometrically infeasible points.

\subsubsection{View Boundaries}
EASAL allows the user to inspect the points that form the boundary between a
region and its parent/child. The boundaries option allows the user to inspect
the boundaries of the Cayley space. The user can step through each of the
boundaries using arrows provided.

\subsubsection{Step Size}
EASAL uses Cayley grid sampling to sample the Cayley space. The user can
specify this step size in the input window (see \figref{inputwindow}). Another
option available to the user is to choose the \emph{dynamic step size} option in the
advanced window (see \figref{advancedoptions}). This tells EASAL to determine 
the step size based on the volume of the space it is sampling. Once a space has
been sampled, there is always the option of refining the sampling. This can be
done by selecting the \emph{refine sampling} option in the atlas view whereupon
EASAL halves the step size and re-samples all the sampled spaces.

\subsection{Cartesian Realization}
The realization view (see \figref{realizationview}) in EASAL shows the
Cartesian realization of the Cayley points. 

\subsubsection{View the sweep and flips of the Cartesian realization}
The sweep feature of a realization keeps one of the point sets units fixed and
draws all the possible orientations the other point set can take relative to the
first one (see \figref{realizationview}). The user can view the sweep. 
When the sweep is being displayed, the user can use
the arrow keys to view the different flips.


\subsubsection{View realization along boundaries}
Clicking on the \emph{boundaries} control allows the user to view the realizations
along the boundary region. The user can view it walk through the boundary
realizations using the arrows provided. Different colors are used to indicate
the realizations along different boundaries.

\subsubsection{View all realizations}
The user can use the video controls at the bottom (see
\figref{realizationview}) to display all the realizations of a region one after
the other. This differs from the sweep view in that sweep view shows all the
realizations at the same time.


\section{Dependencies and installation}
\label{dependency}
This section discusses all the dependencies EASAL requires to run.

\begin{itemize} 
  \item Though technically, this should work on any UNIX variant platform with little to no modifications, it has been thoroughly tested to work on the following platforms. 
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Ubuntu 12.04 or higher.
	\item Fedora 22 or higher.
	\item OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion.
\end{itemize}
  \item We use Version 2.0 of the Eigen library for linear algebra
		  computations. All necessary files pertaining to Eigen required by
		  EASAL are provided with the source code in the \emph{include}
		  directory.  
   
   \item For the GUI, we use OpenGL for visualization and the
		  opensource fox-toolkit Version 1.6 for windowing. See the
		  installation section for instructions on installing the necessary
		  libraries.  
		  
   \item We use simpleini to read the settings from the
		  settings.ini file. All necessary files pertaining to simpleini are

\item In the Atlas View, we initially see a root node at the center of a 3D
		grid. As and when more nodes are discovered, they are populated on the
		Atlas.

\item When the tree view is on, it shows only the ancestors and descendants of
		the node selected. When it is off, it shows the entire atlas. This can
		also be achieved by clicking the Tree control at the bottom.

\item In this view, the user can control how the sampling proceeds by using any
		of the controls on the left side of the atlas. The different controls
		available are (in the order they appear)
    - Stop Sampling.
    - Constraint Selection Dialogue Box.
    - Sample the Current Tree.
	- Sample all Incomplete Trees.
	- Auto-Solve.
    - BFS Sampling.
    - Refine Sampling.

\item Clicking on a particular node does the following - Loads the Active
		Constraint Graph at the bottom left corner.  - Loads the Cartesian
		realization for that node in the top right corner if the sampling for
		the node is complete.

		correspond to all the realizable points in the Cayley space.

\item Clicking on the Red square at the bottom, shows the points that have
		collision. Clicking the red also shows two more options viz, cyan and
		pink. The Cyan points represent the points which have angle collision
		and the pink points represent points which have distance collision.

\item Clicking on the Blue square shows all the points sampled including, the
		good, the collision and the unrealizable.

\item Clicking on the Boundaries shows the boundary points and the user can
		step through them along each dimension.
