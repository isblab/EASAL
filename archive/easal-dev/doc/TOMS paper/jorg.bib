       system of polynomials, in a domain of $ ^n$. It can be
       seen as an improvement of the Interval Projected
       Polyhedron algorithm proposed by Sherbrooke and
       Patrikalakis . It uses a powerful reduction strategy
       based on univariate root finder using Bernstein basis
       representation and Descarte's rule. We analyse the
       behavior of the method, from a theoretical point of
       view, shows that for simple roots, it has a local
       quadratic convergence speed and gives new bounds for
       the complexity of approximating real roots in a box of
       $ ^n$. The improvement of our approach, compared with
       classical subdivision methods, is illustrated on
       geometric modeling applications such as computing
       intersection points of implicit curves,
       self-intersection points of rational curves, and on the
       classical parallel robot benchmark problem.",
