1. preprocessing: scripts for generating simulated crosslinks using JWALK and convert cif to pdb files
2. imp: IMP modeling and analysis scripts
3. easal: Wrapper script to run easal
4. analysis: scripts for calculating distance between crosslinked residues and percentage of crosslinks satisfied on easal output pdbs and imp models, RMSD calculation from the native structure and computing efficiency of IMP and EASAL methods.
