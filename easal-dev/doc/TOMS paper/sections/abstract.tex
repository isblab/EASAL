For configurations of point-sets that are pairwise constrained by distance
intervals, the EASAL software implements a suite of algorithms that
characterize the structure and geometric properties of the configuration space.
The algorithms generate, describe and explore these configuration spaces using
generic rigidity properties, classical results for stratification of
semi-algebraic sets, and new results for efficient sampling by convex
parametrization. The paper reviews the key theoretical underpinnings, major
algorithms and their implementation. The paper outlines the main applications
such as computation of free energy and kinetics of assembly of supramolecular
structures or of clusters in colloidal and soft materials. In addition, the
paper surveys select experimental results and comparisons.
