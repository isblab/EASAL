\label{sec:sampleExplore}

When the current active constraint graph $G_F$ is well-constrained, the stratum is $d=0$, i.e.\ there is no free parameter left.
Hence it will stop discovering a new active constraint region.
Otherwise, it exhaustively explores the region $R_{G_F}$ parametrized by $H$. %It samples uniformly with step size \stp\ within exact convex cover of the Cayley parametrized region.
Exploration (binary search) is required in order to detect the boundary of lower-dimensional region.
If a new active constraint (edge $e$) become active, then a child \textit{atlas} node is created labeled by $G_F \cup \{e\}$.
Then sampleExplore is recursively called to explore new\_AtlasNode and discover the corresponding lower dimensional region.\\

\subsubsection{ Method \textsf{boundaryDetection()}}
\label{sec:boundaryDetection}


In order to detect the (lower-dimensional) boundaries that always lay
between a feasible region and a violated region, for each feasible
Cayley point it \troy{it?} checks all Cayley parameter directions to
see if the neighboring point is a violated point or not. If it is,
then binary search will take place to find out the boundary point with
new active constraints. So each Cayley point is sampled $2d+1$ times,
$1$ time on the grid point and $2d$ times on the neighboring points on
all parameters' direction. (Note: A boolean map of grid that stores
the status (feasible/violated/infeasible) of all neighboring points,
would eliminate recreating neighbor points. However the size of map
which is size of chart/step size would require ram for high number of
dimensions)\\

\begin{algorithm} [htbp]
  \SetKwInOut{Input}{input}\SetKwInOut{Output}{output}

  {\bf boundaryDetection}\\
  \Input{cayleyPoint}
  \Output{cayleyPoint}
  \BlankLine

	\For{ each neighbour point pn around p }
	{
		\If{ pn is violated by sterics }
		{
			// find boundary region in between p and pn through binary search \\

			half the step size;\\
			witness = walk back through p with step ;\\

			\While{ no new constraints in G have become active }
			{
				half the step size; 	\\
				\eIf{ witness is violated by sterics }
				{	witness = walk through p with step }
				{	witness = walk through pn with step }
			}
		}
	}
	return witness;\\

%(SpaceView -> ChartView)
%is it good to keep the solver and data structure in same class, as in ACG or cayleyparametrization?
